# As you consider using Service Fabric platform for Microservices development, I have found that having the following knowledge is essential to consider.   
## One should have familiarity with characteristics of Microservices agnostic of the technology or platform, including general familiarity with Microservices characteristics and design patterns 

1. **Autonomous**: A self-contained unit of functionality with loosely coupled dependencies on other services. 
2. **Isolated**: A unit of deployment that can be modified, tested and deployed as a unit without impacting other areas of a solutionElastic: Microservices are designed to be stateful or stateless and can be scaled independently of other services. 
3. **Resilient**: Fault tolerant and highly available. 
4. **Responsive**: Services that respond to requests in a reasonable amount of time. 
5. **Message Oriented**: Services that rely on synchronous or asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components 
6. **Configurable**: Services that provide an API and/or a console that provides access to administrative operations. 
7. **Automated**: Services whose lifecycle is managed through automation that includes development, build, test, staging, production and distribution. 
8. **Programmable**: Services that provide API’s for access by developers and administrators and applications are composed from multiple microservices.   

## General familiarity with common Design Patterns used in Microservices is also very helpful
1. **Service Discovery** 
2. **BoundedContext**
3. **ResilienceAPI** 
4. **API Gateway**
5. **Monitoring**
6. **Feature Flags** 
7. **CQRS**
8. **Consumer-Driven Contract** 
9. **Event Sourcing**
